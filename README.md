# Team Culture Map

The team culture map helps to create a detailed profile of each participant to improve interactions and build strong teams.

[Characteristics](#characteristics) | [Scale](#scale) | [Analysis](#analysis)

## Characteristics

Each characteristic includes 2 opposing statements: Left <-> Right.

[Communication](#communication) | [Criticism](#criticism) | [Persuasion](#persuasion) | [Leadership](#leadership) | [Decision-Making](#decision-making) | [Trust](#trust) | [Disagreement](#disagreement) | [TimeÂ Management](#time-management)

### Communicating
Low-context <-> High-context

#### Low-context
Good communication is precise, simple, and clear. Messages are expressed and understood at face value. Repetition is appreciated if it helps clarify the communication.

#### High-context
Good communication is sophisticated, nuanced, and layered. Messages are both spoken and read between the lines. Messages are often implied but not plainly expressed.

### Evaluating
Direct <-> Indirect negative feedback

#### Direct negative feedback
Negative feedback to a colleague is provided frankly, bluntly, honestly. Negative messages stand alone, not softened by position ones. Absolute descriptors are often used (totally inappropriate, completely unprofessional) when criticizing. Criticism may be given to an individual in front of a group.

#### Indirect negative feedback
Negative feedback to a colleague is provided softly, subtly, diplomatically. Positive messages are used to wrap negative ones. Qualifying descriptors are often used (soft of inappropriate, slightly unprofessional) when criticizing. Criticism is given only in private.

### Persuading
Principles-first <-> Applications-first

#### Principles-first
Individuals are trained to begin with a fact, statement, or opinion and later add concepts to back up or explain the conclusion as necessary. The preference is to begin a message or report with an executive summary or bullet points. Discussions are approached in a practical, concrete manner. Theoretical or philosophical discussions are avoided in a business environment.

#### Applications-first
Individuals have been trained to first develop the theory or complex concept before presenting a fact, statement, or opinion. The preference is to begin a message or report by building up a theoretical argument before moving on to a conclusion. The conceptual principles underlying each situation are valued.

### Leading
Egalitarian <-> Hierarchical

#### Egalitarian
The ideal distance between a boss and a subordinate is low. The best boss is a facilitator among equals. Organizational structures are flat. Communication often skips hierarchical lines.

#### Hierarchical
The ideal distance between a boss and a subordinate is high. The best boss is a strong director who leads from the front. Status is important. Organizational structures are multilayered and fixed. Communication follows set hierarchical lines.

### Deciding
Consensual <-> Top-down

#### Consensual
Decisions are made in groups through unanimous agreement.

#### Top-down
Decisions are made by individuals (usually the boss).

### Trusting
Task-based <-> Relationship-based

#### Task-based
Trust is built through business-related activities. Work relationships are built and dropped easily, based on the practicality of the situation. You do good work consistently, you are reliable, I enjoy working with you, I trust you.

#### Relationship-based
Trust is built through sharing meals, evening drinks, and visits at the coffee machine. Work relationships build up slowly over the long term. I've seen who you are at a deep level, I've shared personal time with you, I know others well who trust you, I trust you.

### Disagreeing
Confrontational <-> Avoids confrontation

#### Confrontational
Disagreement and debate are positive for the team or organization. Open confrontation is appropriate and will not negatively impact the relationship.

#### Avoids confrontation
Disagreement and debate are negative for the team or organization. Open confrontation is inappropriate and will break group harmony or negatively impact the relationship.

### Scheduling
Linear-time <-> Flexible-time

#### Linear-time
Project steps are approached in a sequential fashion, completing one task before beginning the next. One thing at a time. No interruptions. The focus is on the deadline and sticking to the schedule. Emphasis is on promptness and good organization over flexibility.

#### Flexible-time
Project steps are approached in a fluid manner, changing tasks as opportunities arise. Many things are dealt with at once and interruptions accepted. The focus is on adaptability, and flexibility is valued over organization.

## Analysis

To obtain a score of each characteristic, the average value of its statements is calculated.  

Participant profiles can be visualized using baseball cards displaying their characteristics.

To compare the scores of all characteristics across participants, the data can be displayed on a shared graph.
